## 1. Project Description & Objectives
### Project Title: EduGalaxy – Parent Dashboard

This project provides a web-based **Parent Dashboard** that allows parents to:
- View and analyze their child's learning data and performance across multiple subjects.
- Track focus time, daily activity, and progress reports.
- Set daily time limits for game play.
